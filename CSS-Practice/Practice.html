 <h4>Many training strategies and behavioural modification programs aimed at dogs focus on re-shaping dogs to meet the expectation of people.</h4>
 <h4>Many dogs simply cannot cope with this process.</h4>
 <h4>Every Dog Every Day will introduce you to a mindset from which will give you a different view of your dogâ€™s innate behaviours and learn the celebrate what they are and not try to suppress their spirit.</h4>
